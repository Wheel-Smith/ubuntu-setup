## Packages installed (additionally):

## issues


## To-do:
- make changes to omakub application (after satisfied with the setup)
- add breaking_bad theme to themes
- remove the desktop apps i dont need...
- if switching to amethyst, some adjustments need to be made in set-gnome-extensions in install/

### Trying to map the process
1. install.sh  -> cloning project to ~/.local/share/omakub/
              |-> asks for first run choices
              |-> installs terminal tools
              |-> installs desktop apps

### What?
